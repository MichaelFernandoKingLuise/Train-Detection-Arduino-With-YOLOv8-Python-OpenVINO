This repository presents a train detection system built using YOLOv8 and implemented in Python, with performance optimizations enabled by OpenVINO. The system leverages YOLOv8 for detecting and tracking trains in video feeds, with improved speed and efficiency achieved through the integration of OpenVINO.
